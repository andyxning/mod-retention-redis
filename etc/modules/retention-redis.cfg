    # keys expire time. If we do not specify this option or specify it to 0,
    # it is persistent, i.e. no expire time. Otherwise, we specify expire time
    # in seconds. In case we change the configuration of Shinken, some service
    # or host retention info will be deleted and then become useless. We can
    # then add an expire time to each host or service info to make the useful
    # retention persistent long by updating the expire time every time we save
    # the retention info and the useless ones expired sometime and deleted
    # automatically by Redis.
